"""WorkAllocationService — zone-based persistent round-robin allocation.

One allocation step selects one employee from the FINAL eligible zone or
area pool. The pointer is derived from committed allocation history scoped
by location + work type; zone state rows and area rows are locked with
SELECT … FOR UPDATE so concurrent batches can't land on the same slot.
Manual reassignment never touches the pointer.

Called by both MaintenanceService and TaskService — the algorithm is not
duplicated.
