"""Operational-day rollover — abandon unfinished tasks at the day boundary.

An operational day runs from `company.operational_day_start` (HH:MM, IST)
to the same time the next calendar day. When the clock crosses that
boundary every still-open task anchored to a PAST operational day is
marked `abandoned` with the full audit trail stamped on the row and an
`abandoned` TaskHistoryEvent.

Safety model:
  * Conditional UPDATE — a row is only abandoned while its status is in
    OPEN_STATUSES, so a task completed (or cancelled) between the
    candidate scan and the update is untouched. Deterministic under a
    completion race.
  * Idempotent — abandoned rows are no longer in the open set, so
    re-running the sweep is a no-op; no duplicate history events.
  * Tick-friendly — called from the embedded scheduler loop and the arq
    generation_tick; double execution is harmless by construction.

Maintenance tickets are deliberately NOT touched here — a ticket records
a real-world defect that persists across operational days (carry-forward
policy). Their daily history is reconstructed window-wise by
`services/maintenance_analysis.py` from the event stream instead.

This module ALSO owns the recurring-occurrence expiry sweep
(`expire_due`) — a deliberately DISTINCT concept from the daily rollover:

  * Daily rollover (REASON_SYSTEM_DAILY_ROLLOVER) closes live work whose
    operational DAY has ended.
  * Occurrence expiry (REASON_NEXT_SCHEDULED_OCCURRENCE) closes a
    recurring instance whose own validity window (`expires_at`) has
    ended — i.e. the next scheduled boundary of its template/series has
    arrived. `expires_at` is stamped at generation from the recurrence
    interval and is NEVER extended by scheduler downtime.

The tick runs expiry BEFORE generation, so a still-open predecessor is
abandoned before the next occurrence is inserted — an unfinished
instance can never block its successor.

        BEFORE generation in every tick so an unfinished predecessor
        releases its (property, room, title) slot and cannot block the
        next occurrence. Independent of target expansion — a zero-target
        occurrence still expires its predecessor.

        `template_id` scopes the pass to one template's instances (used
        when generation is invoked directly, outside the ordered tick).
        `target` narrows it to one expanded-target's predecessor —
        single-target "Generate Now" only supersedes the instance
        covering THAT unit (room/dorm/bed/washroom/zone), not the other
        targets of the same occurrence.
        `boundary` overrides the expiry cutoff — manual "Generate Now"
        expires predecessors up to the occurrence being generated while
        still stamping `abandoned_at` with the real time.
        `include_windowless` also matches open rows with `expires_at IS
        NULL` — legacy instances generated before occurrence windows
        existed. Scoped calls (template generation, Generate Now) use it
        because a windowless open task in the same template+target scope
        is necessarily a predecessor and would otherwise block the next
        occurrence forever (only daily rollover could clear it). The
        global tick sweep leaves it off — windowless rows stay under
        daily-rollover governance.
